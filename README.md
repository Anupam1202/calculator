# calculator
The provided code implements a calculator functionality in a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It captures user input and performs calculations based on the clicked buttons.
The code selects the input element where the calculator's display is shown and assigns it to the variable 'input'.
It also selects all the buttons on the page and assigns them to the variable 'buttons'.
The code then adds event listeners to each button, determining the action based on the button's innerHTML.
The code handles operations such as evaluating the expression, clearing the input, deleting the last character, and appending digits or operators to the expression.
This implementation allows users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions in the calculator interface.
